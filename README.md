# Student-Dataset-Linear-Regression-Model

The code performs a comprehensive analysis of a student performance dataset, extracting all the details from the csv file and manipulating it as following:
1. Data Exploaration using Univariate Analysis
2. Data Exploaration using Bivariate Analysis
3. Linear Regression
4. Building the model further
5. Model evaluation and Visualisation
6. Predicting a particular field's outcome
It focuses on predicting students' physics marks based on various features.

This is a rather basic level project which touches upon these topics ligtly for I am only beginning to learn and apply these concepts. However, I aim to make this code more efficient, clear, and easy to use in order to provide better functionality as well as detail about the given dataset.
